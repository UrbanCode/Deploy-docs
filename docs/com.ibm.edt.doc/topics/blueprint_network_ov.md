# Modeling networks

You can refer to existing network stacks in blueprints created on the blueprint design server, or you can create new network elements.

In blueprints, you can model simple networks to specify how virtual images are connected to each other and to public and private networks. On all types of target clouds, you can connect new images and other resources to existing network resources on the cloud. On some types of target clouds, you can model and provision new network resources, such as networks and routers, and connect virtual images to those new network resources.

-   **[Attaching resources to existing networks](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_network_existing.md)**  
Existing internal and external networks are included in the blueprint designer palette. You can attach new resources, such as virtual images, to those network resources.
-   **[Modeling new network resources](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_network_create.md)**  
You can model new network resources, such as routers and networks. When you provision the blueprint, the target cloud creates the network resources.
