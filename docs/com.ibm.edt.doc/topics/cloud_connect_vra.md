# Connecting to VMware vRealize Automation v7 and v7.1

To connect to a VMware vRealize Automation Enterprise cloud, create a functional ID for the vRealize Automation account. Then, create the flavors for environments.

You can connect the blueprint designer to VMware vRealize Automation instances that are only version 7 or 7.1.

When you integrate with a VMware vRealize Automation Enterprise server, you can create blueprints that model deployments to the vCenter servers that are connected to the vRealize Automation server. The blueprints can incorporate software component and catalog resources from the vRealize Automation server.

To integrate the blueprint design server with VMware vRealize Automation Enterprise, you must first configure the integration.
-   **[Configuring VMware vRealize Automation image flavors](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/cloud_connect_vra_flavors.md)**  
Flavors represent the capacity of images, including memory, storage space, and processor capacity. You must configure a set of flavors for VMware vRealize Automation Enterprise.
-   **[Configuring services and entitlements in VMware vRealize Automation](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/VRA_service_entitle.md)**  
After you configure the integration with VMware vRealize Automation Enterprise, you can create a default service and a default entitlement to use with the blueprint designer.
-   **[Creating agent components in VMware vRealize Automation](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/VRA_agent_component.md)**  
After you configure the integration with VMware vRealize Automation Enterprise, you can create software components for HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy agents.
