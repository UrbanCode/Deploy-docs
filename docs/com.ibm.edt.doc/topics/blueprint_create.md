# Editing blueprints with the blueprint designer

When you work with blueprints, you can use a graphical editor or a source-code editor.

-   **[Creating files with the blueprint designer](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_edit.md)**  
You can create blueprints, configuration files, text files, binary files, and folders in the blueprint designer.
-   **[Editing blueprint diagrams](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_diagram.md)**  
You can edit blueprints in a graphical editor.
-   **[Editing blueprint source code](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_source.md)**  
You can edit the Heat Orchestration Template \(HOT\) source code of blueprints directly.
-   **[Editing configuration files](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_configs.md)**  
Configuration files are lists of properties and values. You can use configuration files to provision the same blueprint on multiple cloud systems.
-   **[Converting TOSCA files to blueprints for the blueprint designer](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_tosca.md)**  
You can convert Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications \(TOSCA\) files to the HOT format and import them into the blueprint designer.
-   **[Creating composite blueprints](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_import.md)**  
You can create a composite blueprint by importing the contents of a saved blueprint into your active blueprint.
-   **[Modifying blueprints to access the Chef validator key in version 6.2.1 and later](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/chef_validator.md)**  
If you upgrade your blueprint design server to version 6.2.1 or later, you might need to modify references to the Chef validator key before you provision environments from existing blueprints.
