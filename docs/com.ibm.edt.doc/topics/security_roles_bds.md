# Configuring blueprint design server user roles

In the blueprint designer, roles include the permission to create and edit artifacts.

1.   In the blueprint designer, click **Settings** \> **Roles**. 
2.   In the list of roles, click a role or click **Create New Role** and specify the name of the new role. 
3.   In the **Permissions** section, specify the permissions for the role. Permissions allow users to view, create, and edit artifacts, such as blueprints and environments.
4.   Click **Save**. 

Assign the role to one or more users that are on a team. You cannot assign a role to a user directly; the user must be a member of a team.
