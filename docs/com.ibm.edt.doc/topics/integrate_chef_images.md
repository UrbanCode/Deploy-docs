# Creating Chef-compatible images

To use images with Chef and the blueprint designer, you must create the images with certain prerequisites.

Chef roles are supported only on Red Hat Enterprise Linux™ \(RHEL\) version 6 and version 7 images, and you cannot use Chef roles with all clouds.

For specific instructions for creating Chef-compatible images, see the following topics:

-   To create individual Chef-compatible images for OpenStack and OpenStack-based clouds, see [Configuring OpenStack images](cloud_connect_openstack_images.md). To create multiple Chef-compatible images for OpenStack and OpenStack-based clouds, see [Using a dedicated environment to create Chef-compatible images on OpenStack-based clouds](integrate_chef_images_openstack.md).
-   To create Chef-compatible images on SoftLayer® clouds, see [Configuring private SoftLayer images](cloud_connect_softlayer_images.md).
-   To create Chef-compatible images on VMware vCenter, see [Configuring VMware vCenter images](cloud_connect_vmware_images.md).
