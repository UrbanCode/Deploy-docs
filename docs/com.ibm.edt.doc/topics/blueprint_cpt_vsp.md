# Blueprints for clouds that use virtual system patterns

You provision resources on virtual system pattern-based clouds through application blueprints in the HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy server.

This type of blueprint begins with a resource template, which is a representation of the resources on a virtual system pattern \(VSP\), including the agents that will be created on the virtual images in the VSP. Then a blueprint maps components to the agents on that resource template. The resulting blueprint provides a pattern for an environment, including which components are deployed on which agents.

This type of blueprint is edited in the HCL UrbanCode Deploy server. To open a blueprint, click **Applications**, click the application, and then click the **Applications** tab for that application. For information about editing this type of blueprint, see [Modeling environments for clouds that use virtual system patterns](blueprint_edit_clouds_vsp.md).
