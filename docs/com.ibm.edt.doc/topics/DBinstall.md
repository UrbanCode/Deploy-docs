# Installing the server database

HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy requires a database. You can use the following database types for an evaluation or production server.

If you are installing an evaluation server, you can also allow the server installation program to install an Apache Derby database for you. In this case, you do not need to install a database yourself. However, you cannot use Derby for production servers. Derby is for evaluation only. To use this method, run the installation program, and when the program prompts you for the type of database, specify Derby.
