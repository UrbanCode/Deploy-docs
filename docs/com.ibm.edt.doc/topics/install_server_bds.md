Installing the blueprint design server involves installing an application on Apache Tomcat. You can install the blueprint design server in interactive mode or in silent mode.

-   **[Blueprint design server database configuration](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/install_database_bds_ov.md)**  
The HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy blueprint design server requires a database. For production installations, you can install a database, or you can reuse an engine database.
-   **[Installing the blueprint design server in interactive mode](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/install_server_interactive_bds.md)**  
In interactive mode, you install the blueprint design server by typing configuration information in a command-line program. This installation includes the cloud discovery service.
-   **[Installing the blueprint design server in silent mode](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/install_server_silent_bds.md)**  
In silent mode, you install the blueprint design server by specifying configuration information in command-line arguments. This installation includes the cloud discovery service.
-   **[Connecting the blueprint design server to the server](../../com.ibm.udeploy.doc/topics/ucdp_integrate.md)**  
In most cases, you connect the blueprint design server to the server at installation time, but you can also connect them later.
-   **[Configuring SSL security on Apache Tomcat for the blueprint design server](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/ssl_config_server_bds.md)**  
The steps for configuring secure HTTP connections with the blueprint design server are similar to the steps for any Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition server.
