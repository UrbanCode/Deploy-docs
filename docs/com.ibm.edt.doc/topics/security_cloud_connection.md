# Connecting to clouds through the blueprint designer

To create a connection to a cloud to use with the blueprint designer, you use OpenStack Heat. You specify the location of the identity server and the engine to use. The steps are different for each type of cloud.

-   **[Connecting to OpenStack and OpenStack-based clouds](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/cloud_connect_openstack.md)**  
There are two ways to connect to an OpenStack cloud or a cloud that is based on OpenStack, such as IBM® Cloud Orchestrator. Which method you choose depends on whether you want to use user accounts from an LDAP server or from an OpenStack Keystone server.
-   **[Connecting to Google Cloud Platform](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/cloud_connect_google_cloud.md)**  
To connect to a Google Cloud Platform cloud, create an API key file for your project's service account.
-   **[Connecting to the SoftLayer cloud](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/cloud_connect_softlayer.md)**  
To connect to the SoftLayer® cloud, create a functional ID for the SoftLayer® account. Then, configure images to work with the SoftLayer® cloud and the blueprint design server.
-   **[Connecting to Amazon Web Services](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/cloud_connect_amazon.md)**  
To connect to Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), you must provide AWS account information in a functional ID. You must also register Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(EC2\) images with the cloud discovery service.
-   **[Connecting to VMware vCenter v5.5 to 6.0](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/cloud_connect_vmware.md)**  
To connect to a VMware vCenter cloud, create a functional ID for the vCenter account. Then, create the flavors for environments.
-   **[Connecting to VMware vRealize Automation v7 and v7.1](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/cloud_connect_vra.md)**  
To connect to a VMware vRealize Automation Enterprise cloud, create a functional ID for the vRealize Automation account. Then, create the flavors for environments.
-   **[Connecting to Microsoft Azure](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/cloud_connect_azure.md)**  
To connect to Microsoft™ Azure, you must provide Azure account information in a functional ID.
