# Connecting to Microsoft Azure

To connect to Microsoftâ„¢ Azure, you must provide Azure account information in a functional ID.

The following diagram shows a typical topology for this scenario. The blueprint design server and engine connect to Azure. For authentication information, the blueprint design server connects to the Keystone identity service and, optionally, to an LDAP server.![A topology that includes the blueprint design server, an engine, Azure, a Keystone server, and an optional LDAP server](../images/cloud_connect_azure_a.gif)
