# Creating cloud projects for the blueprint designer

A cloud project for the blueprint designer represents a tenant or project on a cloud system. You can give users access to cloud systems through cloud projects.

-   Connect the blueprint design server to a cloud. See [Connecting to clouds through the blueprint designer](security_cloud_connection.md).
-   On that cloud system, create one or more accounts and configure their access. The blueprint designer users use these functional IDs to access the cloud. You can create multiple functional IDs for each cloud and grant the functional IDs appropriate access for each team that you configure on the blueprint designer.
-   If you do not use the Keystone server that was supplied with the engine, create one or more Keystone accounts. You can create one account with all permissions, including creating instances, or you can create separate accounts with different permissions. The accounts must be members of the administrative tenant. If you create one account, you can define access to resources for each team.

    **Note:** If you use the Keystone server that is supplied with engine, you can use the default account on the administrative tenant. The The Keystone server's default administrative tenant user name is `admin` and the default password is `openstack1`.
