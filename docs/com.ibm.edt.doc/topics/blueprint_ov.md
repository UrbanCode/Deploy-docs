# Modeling cloud environments with the blueprint designer

HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy provides tools for modeling cloud environments. You can use these cloud environments to provide application environments on demand. You use the blueprint designer to model some types of cloud environments, and virtual system patterns for other types of environments.

-   **[Overview of blueprints](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_cpt.md)**  
Two types of blueprints are available, depending on how you connect to the target cloud.
-   **[Modeling environments for clouds that use virtual system patterns](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_edit_clouds_vsp.md)**  
To model environments for clouds that use virtual system patterns \(VSPs\), on the server, import a virtual system pattern as a resource template and then create a blueprint that is based on the resource template.
-   **[Modeling environments for clouds through OpenStack Heat](../../com.ibm.edt.doc/topics/blueprint_edit_clouds.md)**  
To model environments for clouds that you connect to through OpenStack Heat, create blueprints on the blueprint design server.
