# Installing the server

The server provides services such as the user interface used to configure application deployments, the workflow engine, the security service, and the artifact repository, among others. Installing the server involves specifying configuration information for the server, such as the ports that the server uses.

You can install the server in interactive mode or in silent mode.

In interactive mode, you install the server by typing configuration information on the command line.
-   **[Installing the server in silent mode](../../com.ibm.udeploy.install.doc/topics/server_install_silent.md)**  
In silent mode, you specify the installation properties in a text file and then run the server installation without command-line prompts.
