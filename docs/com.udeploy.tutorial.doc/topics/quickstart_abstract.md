# Create a simple helloWorld deployment

In this tutorial, you create a simple application with HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy. You use standard plug-ins to create a component and define an application that deploys the component to an environment.

## Learning objectives

In this tutorial, you learn how to complete these tasks:

-   Create a component and add a user-defined property to it.
-   Import artifacts to create a component version.
-   Create a component process.
-   Create an application and application process.
-   Configure an environment with resources and apply a user-defined tag to it.
-   Run the application process to deploy the component.

Time required:1 hour

-   **[Introduction](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_intro.md)**  
In this tutorial, you create a simple application with HCL UrbanCode Deploy. You use standard plug-ins to create a component and define an application that deploys the component to an environment.
-   **[Configure the helloWorld tutorial system](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_configure.md)**  
To deploy the tutorial component, or any component, you must have an agent. An agent is a lightweight process that runs on a target computer and does the actual work of deploying components.
-   **[Lesson 1: Create the helloWorld component](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_createComponent.md)**  
Components contain artifacts and processes. Artifacts include runnable files, images, databases, configuration instructions, and anything else that is associated with a software project. Processes define the activities that components can perform.
-   **[Lesson 2: Create a component process](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_createCompProcess.md)**  
Component processes are user-defined tasks that operate on components.
-   **[Lesson 3: Create an application](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_application.md)**  
Applications manage components, typically by deploying them into environments.
-   **[Lesson 4: Configure an application environment](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_app_environment.md)**  
When you create an environment, you map resources to it that define where the parent application can run deployments.
-   **[Lesson 5: Create an application process](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_app_process.md)**  
Application processes direct underlying component processes and orchestrate multi-component deployments.
-   **[Lesson 6: Deploy the component](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_run_app.md)**  
To deploy the component, run the application process on an environment.
-   **[Summary](../../com.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/quickstart_summary.md)**  
In this tutorial, you learned how to deploy a component with HCL UrbanCode Deploy.
