# Supported TLS and SSL protocols and ciphers

HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy supports multiple SSL protocols and ciphers for communication between servers.

HCL UrbanCode Deploy supports TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 SSL protocols. HCL UrbanCode Deploy supports only the SSLv3 protocol if older agents require its use. See [Upgrading agents](upgradeAgents.md#).

**Note:** Limiting and disabling SSL and TLS protocols and ciphers is done at the JVM level rather than the application level.

HCL UrbanCode Deploy uses SSL in communication between the web UI and the server and between servers that use ActiveMQ. The SSL certificates that control both types of communication use the Java™ KeyStore \(JKS\) format. The certificates are generated by an RSA key with a 2048-bit length and are signed by a SHA256withRSA algorithm.

-   By default, the web UI connects on port 8443. You find its certificate in the opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat.keystore directory. See [SSL configuration](../../com.udeploy.doc/topics/SSLinstall.md).
-   By default, ActiveMQ connects on port 7918. You find its SSL certificate in the app\_data/conf/server.keystore directory. See [Configuring mutual authentication](ssl_mutual_auth.md).

The following SSL cipher suites are enabled by default:
