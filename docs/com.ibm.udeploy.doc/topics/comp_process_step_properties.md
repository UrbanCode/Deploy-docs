# Process step properties

All steps have the following properties: `exitCode`, `status`, and `lines of interest` \(LOI, which are items that the post-processing script finds in the step's output log\).

You can view the properties by using the component's Log pane to examine the step's output log \(**Components** \> **selected component \> Component request history ** \> **View Request** \> **Properties**\).

Inventory and versions statuses, which are defined with the status property, can be used in application approval gates \(see [Environment gates](app_gate.md)\). The other properties can be used by post-processing scripts, see [The post-processing element](../../com.ibm.udeploy.reference.doc/topics/ref_create_postprocessing.md).
