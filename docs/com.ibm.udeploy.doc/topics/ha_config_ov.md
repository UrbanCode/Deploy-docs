# High availability and failover

You can configure clustered HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy servers, blueprint design servers, and agents for high availability. You can also configure agents and agent relays for failover.

In most cases, you configure servers to be part of a high-availability cluster when you install them, but you can also convert existing servers to a cluster. To configure a high-availability cluster of HCL UrbanCode Deploy servers, see [Setting up high-availability clusters](server_install_clustered.md). To configure a high-availability cluster of blueprint design servers and engines, see [Setting up clusters of blueprint design servers](ha_config_bds.md).

-   **[High availability overview](../topics/ha_overview.md)**  
To configure clustered high availability for HCL UrbanCode Deploy, you must use a load balancer. You can configure a cold standby server by using a load balancer or configuring the servers' DNS.
