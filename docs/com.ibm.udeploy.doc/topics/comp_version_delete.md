# Deleting versions

If specific component versions meet the criteria for deletion, you can delete them.

If you want to archive deleted versions, click **Settings** \> **System Settings** and in the **Archive Path** field, specify a folder location for archived versions. Then, click **Save**.

To delete a version, use the **Delete** action for the version: click **Components** \> **selected component** \> **Versions** \> **selected version** \> **Delete**. Deleting a version removes the artifacts from CodeStation and the component version from the list of versions.

**Note:** You cannot delete a component version that was deployed by an application or is used in an application, application snapshot, or resource.

To archive old component versions so that you can restore them later, see [Cleaning up component versions](settings_system_preview.md).

If you specified a folder for archived versions, the deleted version artifacts are in that folder.
