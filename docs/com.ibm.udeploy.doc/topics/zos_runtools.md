# Creating z/OS component versions

You can create z/OS component version by running the buztool.sh command from job control language \(JCL\) or from the z/OS® UNIX™ System Services command line. You can also create z/OS component version by using the z/OS File Source Config plug-in.

In an automated system, typically, you write a script that runs the buztool.sh command after a build is created by your build system. The buztool.sh command then creates a component version which can be deployed using a deploy process.

You can work with the component that contains z/OS files as you would work with any other component in HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy. Use the z/OS Utility plug-in to create processes that deploy components that contain z/OS files. See the HCL UrbanCode Deploy website for information about the z/OS Utility plug-in: [HCL UrbanCode Deploy](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins/ibm-urbancode-deploy/).
