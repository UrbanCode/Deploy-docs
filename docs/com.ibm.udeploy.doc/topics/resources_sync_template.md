# Synchronizing resources from a template

 You can add the contents of a resource template to the top-level resource group. 

To add a resource hierarchy to a top-level group in the resource tree, synchronize the group to a resource template. You might complete this task to add a standard group of resources to an existing top-level group. The contents of the resource template are added directly to the group.

1.   Open the Resource Tree page. In addition to the Resource Tree page, resources can be displayed in several ways, such as by adding resources to an environment.
2.   Display the **Action** menu for an empty group and click **Synchronize With Template**. 
3.   From the **Resource Template** list, select a resource template. 
4.   Click **Save**. The resource structure from the resource template is added to the group.

    **Note:** If you subsequently modify the resource template and then repeat the **Synchronize With Template** action, the modified resource structure is added to the group and the original resource structure is preserved. That is, the group will have two resource structures.
