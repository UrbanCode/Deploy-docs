# Integrating with IBM Rational Test Workbench

You can use IBM® Rational® Test Workbench to virtualize services and to run integration tests as part of component processes in HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy.

Rational Test Workbench contains a number of components, including IBM Rational Test Control Panel and IBM Rational Integration Tester. To learn more about Rational Test Workbench, see the [Rational Test Workbench information center](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBLQQ_8.5.0/com.ibm.rational.test.lt.rtw.overview.doc/helpindex_rtw_solution.html?cp=SSBLQQ_8.5.0%2F0). The integration with Rational Test Workbench is supported by the Green Hat plug-in. The IBM Rational Solution for Test Automation were formerly known as Green Hat.

You must have a supported version of an installation of Rational Test Workbench. For instructions about this integration, see IBM developerWorks®: [UrbanCode Deploy Plug-ins](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins/ibm-urbancode-deploy).
