# Join

The Join step merges a process so that only one step runs at a time. If any of the steps that connect to a Join step fail or do not run, the Join step causes the process to fail.

**Tip:** 

Applications, components, and generic processes share some process steps. This step applies to application processes, component processes, and generic processes. This step applies to application processes that are associated with application templates.

For information about this step, see [Branching and joining steps](comp_process_join.md).

This step has no properties.
