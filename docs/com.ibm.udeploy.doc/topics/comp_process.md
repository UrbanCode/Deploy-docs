# Component processes

A component process is a series of user-defined steps that operate on a component's artifacts.

**Tip:** For full coverage of component processes, see [Component processes](intro_component_processes.md#) and its subtopics.

Each component has at least one process and can have several. Component processes are created with the process editor. The process editor is a visual drag-and-drop editor that enables you to drag process steps onto the design space and configure them as you go. Process steps are selected from a menu of standard steps. See [Processes](comp_workflow.md).

HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy provides steps for several utility processes such as inventory management and workflow control. More process steps are provided by plug-ins. HCL UrbanCode Deploy provides plug-ins for many common processes, such as downloading and uploading artifacts, and retrieving environment information. For information about steps that are provided by plug-ins, see the documentation for the individual plug-in on IBM® developerWorks®: [IBM UrbanCode™ Deploy Plug-ins](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins/ibm-urbancode-deploy).

A frequently used process can be saved as a template and applied to other components. See [Component templates](comp_template.md).
