# User impersonation for process steps

HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy can use user impersonation when an agent must run a command for which it might not otherwise have permission, or when a specific user must be employed for a process.

On UNIX™ and Linux™ systems, the su and sudo commands are used to impersonate users; on Windows™ HCL UrbanCode Deploy provides a utility program to handle impersonation. You implement impersonation when you configure a component's plug-in process step or resource.

The su command \(as used by HCL UrbanCode Deploy\) enables a user to start a shell as another user \(process steps can be considered individual shells\).
-   **[Impersonation on Windows systems](../topics/arch_appx_impersonation_windows.md)**  
For agents that are running on Windows, HCL UrbanCode Deploy provides a program that handles impersonation.

The su command is used to impersonate users on agent computers that are running IBM® z/OS®.
