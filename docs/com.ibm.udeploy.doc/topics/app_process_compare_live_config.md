# Compare with Live Configuration

This step is a wrapper step for comparing the configuration of an HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy resource to a live application server.

Applications, components, and generic processes share some process steps. This step applies to application processes, component processes, and generic processes. This step does not apply to application processes that are associated with application templates. This step runs on the server, gathers information about the specified resource, and then calls a specified plug-in step on an agent computer. To use this step, you must install a supported application server plug-in, such as the WebSphere® Application Server - Configure plug-in. For information about plug-ins, see [IBM UrbanCode™ Deploy Plug-ins](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins/ibm-urbancode-deploy).
