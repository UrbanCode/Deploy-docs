# Restoring archived component versions

You can restore component versions by reloading archive files.

These steps assume that you have cleaned up old component versions and stored them in archive files as described in [Cleaning up component versions](settings_system_preview.md). To restore a component version, you must have the archive file that the server created for that component version.

1.  Click **Settings** \> **System Settings**.
2.  Under **Legacy Configuration Options**, select the **Enable "Show Inactive" Links** check box and then click **Save**.
3.  Click **Components**, click the component, and go the **Versions** tab.
4.  Select the **Show Inactive Versions** check box.
5.  Click the component version to restore.
6.  Click **Restore from Backup**. 
7.  Specify the path to the archive file on the server and then click **Save**.
