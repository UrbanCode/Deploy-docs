# Using component templates

When you create a component from a template, the component inherits the template's process and properties, if any.

1.   Display the Create Component window \(**Components** \> **Templates** \> **selected template** \> **Create Component**\). The Create Component dialog box \(the same dialog box that is used to create non-template-based components\) is used to configure components. Properties that are defined in the template are predefined. If a source was selected in the template, the source is set here and the **Source Configuration Type** field is locked. For information about using this dialog, see [Creating components](comp_create.md) 
2.  After you configure editable properties, save the component.

Templates that are used to create components are listed in the Templates view.

Components that are created from templates are listed in the Components view.
