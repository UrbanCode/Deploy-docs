# Build System Toolkit

Each build computer contains an installation of the Rational® Team Concert™ Build System Toolkit.

The Build System Toolkit consists of the following major components:

-   **Jazz™ Build Engine**

    The Jazz™ Build Engine is a command-line tool that polls for and processes build requests from Rational® Team Concert™. When the Jazz™ Build Engine is started, it must identify a corresponding build engine in Rational® Team Concert™. TheJazz™ Build Engine can then accept any build request whose build definition is supported by the build engine. The Jazz™ Build Engine runs the Ant script and targets that are specified in the build definition. Each build is represented in Rational® Team Concert™ by a build result.

-   **Build toolkit**

    The build toolkit is a collection of Ant tasks. Ant scripts can use these tasks to send information \(such as build progress, results, links, artifacts\) to Rational® Team Concert™ to include in the build result.

-   **Build agent**

    The build agent is a lightweight process that handles agent-based builds that support z/OS® or IBM® i build scenarios. For the IBM® MobileFirst Platform Foundation \(Worklight®\) plug-in, use the Jazz™ Build Engine instead.

    **Note:** The Jazz™ Build Engine is a component of the Build System Toolkit; it refers to the process that runs on a build computer and runs Ant scripts.
