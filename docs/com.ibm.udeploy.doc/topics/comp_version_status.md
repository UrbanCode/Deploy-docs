# Statuses

Create and apply statuses to track component inventory states or to track component versions in environments and resources.

Statuses can be used to track component version and component inventory states. Version statuses are used with application gates \(see [Environment gates](app_gate.md)\) to ensure that only component versions that meet certain criteria are deployed. Inventory statuses can track component versions in environments and resources. You can create inventory statuses for any requirement.

You apply a version status to a component that you created. You apply an inventory status when you configure a component process. See [Creating component processes](comp_process_configure.md#).
