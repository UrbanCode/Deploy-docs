# Searching the z/OS environment inventory

The z/OS search feature is available for any application that contains a z/OS type component. Search is performed for a specific file in the artifacts belonging to the z/OS components deployed to that environment.

Files in the z/OS environment can be identified with the **Search Z Artifacts** option available in the z/OS application environment.

1.   Navigate to the environment of interest \(**Applications** \> **application name** \> **Environments** \> **Environment: environment name**. 
2.   From the Properties ellipsis for the environment, select **Search Z Artifacts**. ![Search Z Artifacts selection](../images/zOS_search.jpg) 
3.   Enter the name of the file to search in the Search Z Artifacts dialog, then click **Search.** Results are returned in batches. A maximum of 1000 results are returned per batch, beginning with the most recent version deployed. If the file is not found in the most recent batch, a file not found message is displayed. 
4.   Select **Search Earlier Inventory** to return the next 1000 most recent instances of the file. Subsequent results can be returned until there are no more versions to search. 

    **Note:** 

    The batch size of returned results is configurable and can be changed by adding the property zos.search.batch.size=<number\> to the servers installed.properties file.

    The following information is presented for each batch returned in the search results.

        |**Name**|The name of the file, as imported into CodeStation. The file names are group according to the PDS \(container\) on the mainframe where they are located.|
    |**Deploy Type**|The type of resource the file was mapped to when deployed.|
    |**Inputs**|The inputs to the artifact \(like copybooks\) provided in the shiplist file.|
    |**Component**|The name of the component that belongs to the file.|
    |**Version**|The version the file was deployed in.|
    |**Deployment Time**|The calendar date and time the file was deployed as mm/dd/yyy and hh:mm \(12-hour clock\).|
