# Adding resources from a template

You can add the structure from a resource template to a new group within an existing resource group.

To add a hierarchy of resource to a new group within a group in the resource tree, add resources from a template. You might complete this task to add a new node to an existing resource group.

1.   Open the Resource Tree page. In addition to the Resource Tree page, resources can be displayed in several ways, such as by adding resources to an environment.
2.   Display the **Action** menu for the group and click **Add From Template**. 
3.   Provide a name for the new resource group. 
4.   From the **Resource Template** list, select a resource template. 
5.   Click **Save**. The resource structure from the resource template is added to the new group within the existing group.
