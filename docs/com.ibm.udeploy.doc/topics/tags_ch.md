# Tags

A tag is a user-defined, shared, short label that you use to classify, view, and conduct operations on objects such as applications, components, agents, and resources.

If you manage many objects, you can use tags to organize objects so that the user interface is easier to navigate. You can also use tags to simplify deployment operations. If you use application templates, assign tags to components so that you can easily add components to applications that you create from templates.

-   **[Adding tags to objects](../topics/addingtags_tsk.md)**  
 Add tags to objects to simplify object management, to improve object sorting, and to facilitate task execution by tag.
-   **[Grouping servers by using tags](../topics/groupingtags_tsk.md)**  
You can use tagging to group target servers for organized deployments.
-   **[Component tags and component resource tags](../topics/component_tags.md)**  
You can tag components while you work on the **Components** tab, or you can tag components while you work in the **Resources** tab. However, the tags that you associate with components in these two contexts behave differently. Furthermore, you can also include components in a resource by using the tags that are associated with components in the **Component** tab.
