# Deleting components

When a component is deleted, it is removed from the database and CodeStation and cannot be activated later.

To delete a component, use the actions on the Components pane for the intended component.

When a component is deleted, it, along with all versions, is removed from the database and CodeStation. The component cannot be activated later. The original artifacts are not affected; only CodeStation copies are deleted. Components cannot be deleted if they are used by an application. To delete a component that is used by an application, first remove the component from the application.

To delete a specific component version, see [Deleting versions](comp_version_delete.md#).
