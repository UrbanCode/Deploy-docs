# Run Component Process

You can run a component process as a part of a step.

**Tip:** Applications and components share some process steps. This step applies only to component processes.

**Important:** If you have not created another component process before you attempt to place this step into the current process you receive this message: This will call the current process and risk the creation of an infinite loop. Are you sure you want this process to run itself? You can close the message window and work with the properties. However, the only process that you can select in **Component Process** is the current process.
