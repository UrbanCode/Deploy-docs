# Add Inventory Status

With this process step, the component resource that the process is running against will have an inventory entry created for it with the specified status.

**Tip:** 

Applications and components share some process steps. This step applies only to component processes.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|**Status**|The component resource that the process is running against will have an inventory entry created for it with the specified status. Active indicates that the component version is deployed to its target resource. You can create other statuses and have those statuses applied to component versions when processes are complete. The status is displayed on the Inventory panes for the component itself and environments that ran the process.|
