# Defining a new template from the resource tree

You can create a resource template from an existing resource group in the resource tree.

You might complete this task to reuse the hierarchy of a resource group in another location.

**Note:** If the group contains agents, the agents are included in the new resource template. The agents are not replaced with agent prototypes. Ensure that you use the new resource template appropriately.

1.   Open the Resource Tree page. In addition to the Resource Tree page, resources can be displayed in several ways, such as by adding resources to an environment.
2.   Display the **Action** menu for a group, and then click **Define New Template**. 
3.   In the Define New Template window, set the resource template name. 
4.   Set the **Description**, **Parent Template**, and **Teams** for the resource template. See [Creating resource templates](resources_templates_create.md#).
5.   Click **Save**. The resource template is displayed.
