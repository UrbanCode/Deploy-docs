# Getting started with running deployments

You run a deployment by running an application process in a target environment.

You run a deployment in a specific application environment. When you start a deployment, you identify the application process and the component versions \(or snapshot\) to deploy. Any process that is defined for the parent application can be selected. All components that are associated with the application can be used. When you select component versions, you can filter the list to identify components of interest to you.

When an application process starts, the Application Process Request pane displays information about the application's status and provides links to logs and the application manifest. If the process requires an approval or manual task, you respond on this pane also.
