2.  Click **Show** \> **Agents With No Resource**.The Agents With No Resource panel opens.
3.  From the list of agents, select an agent by clicking the :: field in the first column of the list.The list is empty if all agents are associated with resources.
4.  Drag the agent to the resource group to add the agent to that group.
5.  Click **Hide Panel** to close the list of agents.
