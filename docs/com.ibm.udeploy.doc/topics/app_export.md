# Exporting applications

Exporting applications creates a JSON file \(file extension json\) that contains the properties, components \(and their associated properties and processes\), and processes of the applications.

For information about JSON, see [http://www.json.org/](http://www.json.org/).

**Note:** Exporting applications in this way includes only the most recent version of each component process and application process.

1.  When you export an application, components, snapshots and other items that are associated with the application are also exported, including their properties and processes \(if they are available to the exporting server\). Notification schemes are not exported.

    To export one or more applications:

2.   On the Applications pane \(**Applications**\), select the check box next to one or more applications. 
3.   At the top of the table, click **Actions** and then click **Export**. The file is saved in the default download location for your browser.

You can import the application to another server that uses the same version of HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy. See [Importing applications](app_import.md).
