# Copying process steps

You can copy and paste process steps in all process types: component, application, approval, and generic.

Steps that you copy are available until you delete them from the clipboard. Steps are saved to the clipboard on a per-user basis. Steps that you copy are not available in others' clipboards.

1.  Open a process.
2.  On the process step to copy, click the **copy** icon. The copy icon is to the left of the **edit** icon for the step: ![Copy icon](../images/copy_icon.gif). Copying is not supported for the **For Each Agent** step in application processes. The process step is copied to the **Clipboard** folder in the Step Palette.
3.  Expand the **Clipboard** folder in the Step Palette.The steps that you copied are displayed. Only steps that apply to the current process are displayed in the **Clipboard** folder. For example, if you are editing an approval process, only the approval process steps that you copied to the clipboard are displayed.
4.  To paste a step into a process, drag the step from the **Clipboard** folder to the design space.Click the **delete** icon on any step to remove the step from the **Clipboard** folder.
