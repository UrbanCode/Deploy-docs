# Setting up recurring reports

Recurring reports run on a schedule and e-mail the results to you.

-   In the server system settings, in the **Mail Server Settings** section, configure an e-mail server.
-   Make sure that your e-mail address in your account information is correct. Recurring reports are sent to that address.

Recurring reports can run monthly, weekly, or daily.

1.   Create a report as usual. 
2.   Open the report. 
3.   Click **Schedule Recurring Report** ![](../images/recurring_report.gif). 
4.   Set the date on which to start the report, the time to run it, and the frequency for the report, and click **Submit**. 

The server runs the report on the schedule you set and e-mails a CSV file to your e-mail address.

To cancel the recurring report, open the report, click **Schedule Recurring Report**, and select the **Stop scheduling this report?** check box.
