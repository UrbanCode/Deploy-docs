# System properties

System properties are global variables for the server.

System properties are available on the **Settings** tab: click **Settings** \> **Properties**.

References to system properties are similar to the following example:

```
${p:system/propertyName}
```

If you create a `SUCCESS`system variable , for example, you would refer to it as in the following example:

```
echo ${p:system/SUCCESS}
```

Output in this case:

```
SUCCESS
```
