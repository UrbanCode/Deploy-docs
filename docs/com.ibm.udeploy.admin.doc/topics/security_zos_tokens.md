#  IBM z/OS tokens

Tokens are used to authenticate with the HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy server when z/OS® component versions are imported.

## Using Tokens

Tokens are stored in the installed.properties file and can be updated when a new token must be used. Tokens are encrypted after the first time they are used. To learn more about tokens, see [Tokens](security_token.md).
