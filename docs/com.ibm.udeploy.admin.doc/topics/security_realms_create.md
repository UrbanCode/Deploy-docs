# Creating authentication realms for the blueprint designer

To allow users to log into the blueprint designer, you must create an authentication realm for it.

The blueprint design server supports several types of authentication realms.

**Note:** The authentication realms for the blueprint designer are separate from the authentication realms for the HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy server. However, you can import users from HCL UrbanCode Deploy; see [Importing user accounts from HCL UrbanCode Deploy to the blueprint design server](security_realms_ucd.md). If you import users from your HCL UrbanCode Deploy server, you must import users before you connect the blueprint design server to the HCL UrbanCode Deploy server.
