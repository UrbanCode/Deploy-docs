# Creating users manually

You can manually create users on the server for internal security and SSO type authentication realms.

1.   On the server, click **Settings** \> **Authentication \(Users\)** \> **target realm** \> **Create User**. 
2.   In the Create User dialog box, enter the user information: 
    1.   Enter the user name that is associated with the account in the **Username** field. 
    2.   Enter the password for the user in the **Password** field. 
    3.   Enter the user's name in the **Name** field. 
    4.   Enter the email address that is associated with the account in the **Email** field. 
3.   Save your work when you are done. 

After you add a user to an authentication realm, you must also add the user to groups or teams.
