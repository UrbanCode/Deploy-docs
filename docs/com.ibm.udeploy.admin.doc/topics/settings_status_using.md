# Adding version statuses

Manage component version statuses through the version options interface.

You add or remove statuses from individual component versions to provide information about the version. If you copy files to an agent without deploying them, you might apply a `Staged` status to them. When you install the version, you might set the status to `Active`.

1.   To select the component, click **Components** \> **selected component**. 
2.   To select the version, click **Versions** \> **selected version**. 
3.  Click **Add a Status**.
4.  Select the status from the list, and click **Save**. 

Add a status by using the Add Status to Version plug-in step, which is available from the Version plug-in.
