# Creating groups manually

Groups are logical containers that are mechanisms that grant permissions to multiple users; members automatically share a group's permissions. Only authorization realms of the internal storage type can have manually created groups. Others types, such as LDAP, import groups cannot have manually created groups.

**Note:** 

Adding groups to LDAP and SSO realms is deprecated.

1.   On the server, click **Settings** \> **Authorization \(Groups\)** \> **Groups** \> **Create Group**. The Create Group dialog box opens. 
2.   Provide a name for the group. 
3.   Select an authorization realm. Groups are valid only for the selected realm.
4.   Click **Save**.
