# IBM::Azure::Subnet

This type represents a Microsoft™ Azure subnet.

In the blueprint designer, you can configure the properties that the following table includes. Properties are listed as either “core” or “extended.” Each type of property is located in separate sections of the heat resource that you can view in the blueprint designer. You set the core properties in the properties section and set the extended properties in the metadata section of the blueprint.

|Name|Type|Required|Core or extended|Description|
|----|----|--------|----------------|-----------|
|cidr|String|True|Core|The address space for this subnet. This value must be within the range of the virtual network.|
|name|String|True|Core|The name of the subnet. If a subnet with the specified name exists, a new unique name is created.|
|network|String|True|Core|The virtual network name in which to create the subnet.|
|resource\_group|String|True|Extended|The resource group name.|
|region|String|True|Extended|The Azure location. The blueprint designer specifies this property automatically, based on the selected region.|
|route\_table|String|False|Extended|The route table name to attach to the subnet.|
