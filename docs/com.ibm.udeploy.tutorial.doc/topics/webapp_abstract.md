# Deploying a simple web application

In this tutorial, you deploy a simple web application with HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy. You create components, create an application that contains those components, and then deploy the components to an environment.

## Learning objectives

In this tutorial, you learn how to complete these tasks:

-   Import artifacts from a build to create a component in HCL UrbanCode Deploy.
-   Create component processes and application processes to automate deployment tasks.
-   Configure environments on which to deploy applications.
-   Run application processes to deploy the application components.
-   Update an application with new artifacts.

## Time required

2-3 hours

-   **[Introduction](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_intro.md)**  
In this tutorial, you deploy a simple web application with HCL UrbanCode Deploy. You create components, create an application that contains those components, and then deploy the components to an environment.
-   **[Configuring the agent and target system](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_configure_agent.md)**  
To deploy applications with HCL UrbanCode Deploy, you need one or more agents. The server uses the agents to deploy the application components on target systems.
-   **[Lesson 1: Adding components](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_components.md)**  
Components are groups of deployable artifacts that make up an application. Components include runnable files, images, databases, and configuration instructions.
-   **[Lesson 2: Creating component processes](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_component_processes.md)**  
Component processes describe automated tasks that run on components. Component processes can deploy, install, uninstall, update, or run other tasks on a component.
-   **[Lesson 3: Creating an application and an environment](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_application.md)**  
Applications are collections of components. Environments represent systems on which you deploy the application components.
-   **[Lesson 4: Creating an application process](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_application_process.md)**  
Application processes tie together component processes.
-   **[Lesson 5: Deploying the application components](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_deploy.md)**  
To deploy the components in the application, run the application process on the new environment.
-   **[Lesson 6: Updating the application](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_update.md)**  
In the first lesson, you deleted certain versions of the components. In this lesson, you add those versions again to simulate deploying a new version of the components.
-   **[Summary](../../com.ibm.udeploy.tutorial.doc/topics/webapp_summary.md)**  
In this tutorial, you learned to deploy and update an application with HCL UrbanCode Deploy.
