1.   Determine the business impact of your problem. When you report a problem to IBM, you are asked to supply a severity level. Therefore, you must understand and assess the business impact of the problem that you are reporting.

        |**Severity 1**|The problem has a critical business impact: You are unable to use the program, resulting in a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution.|
    |**Severity 2**|This problem has a significant business impact: The program is usable, but it is severely limited.|
    |**Severity 3**|The problem has some business impact: The program is usable, but less significant features \(not critical to operations\) are unavailable.|
    |**Severity 4**|The problem has minimal business impact: The problem causes little impact on operations or a reasonable circumvention to the problem was implemented.|

2.   Describe your problem and gather background information, When you describe a problem to IBM, be as specific as possible. Include all relevant background information so that IBM Software Support specialists can help you solve the problem efficiently. To save time, know the answers to these questions:

    -   What software versions were you running when the problem occurred?

        To determine the exact product name and version, start IBM UrbanCode® Deploy, and click **Help** \> **About** to see the offering name and version number.

    -   What is your operating system and version number \(including any service packs or patches\)?
    -   Do you have logs, traces, and messages that are related to the problem symptoms?
    -   Can you re-create the problem? If so, what steps do you complete to re-create the problem?
    -   Did you change anything on the system? For example, did you change the hardware, operating system, networking software, or other system components?
    -   Are you currently using a workaround for the problem? If so, be prepared to describe the workaround when you report the problem.
3.   Submit your problem to IBM Software Support. You can submit your problem to IBM Software Support in the following ways:
    -   Online: You can report the problem by either:

        -   Opening an online service request by using the IBM Support Assistant. For more information, see [IBM Support Assistant](c_isa.md).
    -   By phone: For the phone number to call in your country or region, see the [IBM Directory of worldwide contacts](http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/) and click the name of your country or geographic region.

If the problem you submit is for a software defect or for missing or inaccurate documentation, IBM Software Support creates an Authorized Program Analysis Report \(APAR\). The APAR describes the problem in detail. Whenever possible, IBM Software Support provides a workaround that you can implement until the APAR is resolved and a fix is delivered. IBM publishes resolved APARs on the Software Support website daily so that other users who experience the same problem can benefit from the same resolution.
