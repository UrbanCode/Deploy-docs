# Exporting component templates {#comp_template_export .task}

Exporting a template creates a JSON file \(file extension json\) that contains the template's configuration information, properties, and processes.

When you export components, applications, processes, or templates, and then import them on a different computer, the same versions of the same plug-ins must be installed on both computers.

To export a template, on the Component Templates pane \(**Components** \> **Templates**\), click the **Export** link in the **Actions** field. You can load the file into a text editor, or save it. If you save it, a file is created with the same name as the selected component, for example, helloWorldTemplate.json.
