# Application blueprints {#app_blueprint .concept}

An application blueprint maps application components to a resource template. When you create an environment or provision one from the cloud, you can use the blueprint as a model.

A blueprint begins with a resource template. This resource template specifies a collection of resources, typically including agent prototypes. In the blueprint, you place components on these agent prototypes. The resulting blueprint provides a pattern for an environment, including which components are deployed on which agents.
