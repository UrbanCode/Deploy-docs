# Exporting components {#comp_export .task}

Importing and exporting can be especially useful if you have multiple IBM® UrbanCode® Deploy servers, for example, and must quickly move or update components.

Exporting components creates a JSON file \(file extension json\) that contains the source configuration information, properties, and processes for the components. For more information about JSON, see [http://www.json.org/](http://www.json.org/).

When you export components, applications, processes, or templates, and then import them on a different computer, the same versions of the same plug-ins must be installed on both computers.

**Note:** Exporting components in this way includes only the most recent version of each component process.

1.  To export components:
2.  On the Components pane \(**Components** \), select the check box next to one or more components. 
3.  At the top of the table, click **Actions** and then click **Export**.

You can load the file into a text editor or save it. Then, you can import the components to another server that uses the same version of IBM UrbanCode Deploy. See [Importing applications](app_import.md). See [Importing components](comp_import.md).
