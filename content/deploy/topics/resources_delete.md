# Deleting resources {#resources_delete .task}

Resources can be deleted by using the Delete action on the Resources page.

1.   Open the Resource Tree page. In addition to the Resource Tree page, resources can be displayed in several ways, such as by adding resources to an environment.
2.   Select the check box that is associated with the resource you want to delete. You can select multiple resources.
3.   From the **Actions** list, click **Delete**. If more than one resource is selected, all resources are deleted. Any subresources that are associated with the selected resources are deleted as well.
