# Restoring archived component versions {#comp_version_restore .task}

You can restore component versions by reloading archive files.

These steps assume that you have cleaned up old component versions and stored them in archive files as described in [Cleaning up component versions](settings_system_preview.md). To restore a component version, you must have the archive file that the server created for that component version.

1.  Click **Settings** \> **System Settings**.
2.  Under **Legacy Configuration Options**, select the **Enable "Show Inactive" Links** check box and then click **Save**.
3.  Click **Components**, click the component, and go the **Versions** tab.
4.  Select the **Show Inactive Versions** check box.
5.  Click the component version to restore.
6.  Click **Restore from Backup**. 
7.  Specify the path to the archive file on the server and then click **Save**.
