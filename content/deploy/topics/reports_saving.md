# Saving and printing reports {#reports_saving .task}

You can print and save report data for all report types. In addition, you can save filter and sort order information for deployment-type reports.

To save report data in a CSV \(comma-separated value\) file, follow these steps:

1.  Set filters, if any, and run the report.
2.  Click **Download CSV**.
3.  From the browser dialog box, save the data to a file, or open the data by using an application that is associated with CSV files.

**Note:** The sort order and hidden or visible column information is not preserved in the CSV file.

To print a report, follow these steps:

1.  Set the filter conditions.
2.  Define the reporting period.
3.  Run the report.
4.  Optional: Set the sort order. Your changes are reflected in the printed report.
5.  Optional: Change the column visibility. By default, all columns are selected to be shown in the printed report. Hidden columns are not shown in the output.
6.  Click **Print** to print the report.
