# Managing UrbanCode Deploy teams {#cr_security_UCDteams .task}

When an UrbanCode Deploy team is imported, in addition to the roster of team members, all applications that are managed by the team are also imported. Imported applications can be used in any deployment that is managed by the team.

If a user is a member of more than one team, they can use the applications from all of their teams. \[Imported applications are managed with UrbanCode Deploy tasks\]\(UCCR\_tasks.html\#tasks\_UDTasks\).

If an imported application has a protected environment, the environment cannot be used until a team member is granted the \*\*ADMIN\*\* permission.

If several imported users have the same email address, such as admins, only one user is created in UrbanCode Velocity.
