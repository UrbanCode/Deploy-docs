# Integrating deployment risk analysis {#c_integrations_dra .concept}

Add the results from unit tests, security scans, and other code coverage tools to your DevOps pipeline. Reduce risk by using test results as quality gates in your delivery pipeline.

Configure a Jenkins job that uses the [IBM Cloud DevOps Insights service](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/DevOpsInsights/about_risk.html#about-deployment-risk). [Reference that job with the DRA task](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_taskType_DRA.md#).
