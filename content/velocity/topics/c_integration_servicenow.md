# Integrating with ServiceNow {#c_integrations_servicenow .concept}

Create and manage ServiceNow change requests with UrbanCode Velocity. Update change requests with Velocity tasks and then react to status changes. Control deployment progress with change request updates.

ServiceNow integrations are managed on the task level. [You configure an integration when you add a ServiceNow task to a deployment plan](../../com.ibm.crelease.doc/topics/cr_taskType_serviceNow.md#). After an integration is configured, other ServiceNow tasks can use the same instance.
