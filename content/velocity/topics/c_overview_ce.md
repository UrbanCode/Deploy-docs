# Overview of the community edition {#c_overview_ce .concept}

Using UrbanCode Velocity Community Edition you can request reports based on your criterion from data retrieved from your UrbanCode Deploy environment. In addition, to reports that your create there are several out-of-the-box reports that you can use right away. Using filters, you can customize the data to view.

The information you learn from reports gives you insights into your development processes. There are number of advantages for gathering reports. You can use the information whether your environment is new to DevOps, making changes, or you have a mature DevOps process. Staying ahead means constant monitoring and improving.

New applications to deploy, team changes, environment changes, and other things that worked well in the past might not function well today. Historical data about your DevOps processes allows you to do the following and more:

-   Explore a project's development maturity
-   Identify files with high error tendency
-   Determine compliance of a project against development practices
-   Learn how your team collaborates and how it can work better
-   Analyze results from unit tests, functional tests, security scans, application scans, and code coverage tools at specified gates in your deployment process
-   View trends in code coverage, builds and deployments
-   View deployment statistics, metrics, and other information about deployment duration, successes, and failures

Reports display in graphical charts and tables making it easy to view trends. And, you can focus in on details.
